<h1>
    The decorator of last resort: <var>@catch</var>
</h1>

<p>
    As mentioned in previous sections, 
    <var>@retry</var> is an appropriate tool for dealing with transient issues. 
    What about issues that are not transient? 
    Metaflow has another decorator, 
    <var>@catch</var> that catches any exceptions that occur during the step and then continues execution of subsequent steps.

The main upside of <var>@catch</var> is that it can make your workflows extremely robust: it will handle all error scenarios from faulty code and faulty data to platform issues. 
The main downside is that your code needs to be modified so that it can tolerate faulty steps.
