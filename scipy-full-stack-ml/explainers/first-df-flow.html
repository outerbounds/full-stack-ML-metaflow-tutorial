<h1> Exploratory Data Analysis </h1>
This lesson uses a Python notebook in which weâ€™re doing exploratory data analysis and building a model.
Notebooks are a common interface for experimentation and collaboration in data science.
In this and upcoming lessons, you will get familiar with how to move between notebooks and the kind of scripting environments that tend to run in production ML systems.
