    Metaflow provides straightforward tools for you to handle all scenarios such as misbehaving code, unanticipated issues with data, and platform issues. 
    For more context, you can see a quick summary of the tools <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/failures#summary">here</a>.

    This lesson focuses on the <var>@retry</var> decorator.
    When you run this flow you will see that sometimes it succeeds without a hitch, but sometimes the start step raises an exception and needs to be retried. 
    By default, retry retries the step three times.
