<h1>
    Scaling to the cloud
</h1>

<p>
    This lesson will look nearly identical to the hyperparameter tuning section of this week.

    Notice, however, there is a <var>@kubernetes</var> decorator above the <var>model3</var> step definition.

    This decorator will send each model trained in the <var>model3</var> step to run on Kubernetes. 

    Metaflow doesn't require you know anything about Kubernetes, beyond how many processors and memomry resources you want to allocate to the compute task.
