<h1>
    Killing zombies with <var>@timeout</var>
</h1>

<p>
By default, there is no timeout for steps. 
If you cause an infinite loop accidentally or query an external service that hangs, 
the step will block the flow forever. 
This is undesirable especially in production runs that should not require human intervention.

Metaflow provides a <var>@timeout</var> decorator to address this issue.

<br><br>

Besides seconds, you can specify minutes and/or hours as the <var>@timeout</var> value. Note that all values specified are cumulative so specifying 10 seconds and 5 minutes will result in a timeout of 5 minutes and 10 seconds.
The above example raises an exception if the <var>@step</var> does not finish in the given time period. This is a good pattern if the timeout is a genuine error condition.
