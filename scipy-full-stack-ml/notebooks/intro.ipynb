    "One of the key questions in modern data science and machine learning, for businesses and practitioners alike, is how do you move machine learning projects from prototype and experiment to production as a repeatable process. In this workshop, we present an introduction to the landscape of production-grade tools, techniques, and workflows that bridge the gap between laptop data science and production ML workflows.\n",

    "We’ll present a high-level overview of the 8 layers of the ML stack: data, compute, versioning, orchestration, software architecture, model operations, feature engineering, and model development. We’ll present a schematic as to which layers data scientists need to be thinking about and working with, and then introduce attendees to the tooling and workflow landscape. In doing so, we’ll present a widely applicable stack that provides the best possible user experience for data scientists, allowing them to focus on parts they like (modeling using their favorite off-the-shelf libraries) while providing robust built-in solutions for the foundational infrastructure.\n"
