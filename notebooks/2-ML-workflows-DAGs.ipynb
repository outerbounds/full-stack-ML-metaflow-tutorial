    "> Metaflow follows the dataflow paradigm which models a program as a directed graph of operations. This is a natural paradigm for expressing data processing pipelines, machine learning in particular. We call the graph of operations a flow. You define the operations, called steps, which are nodes of the graph and contain transitions to the next steps, which serve as edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Metaflow sets some constraints on the structure of the graph. For starters, every flow needs a step called start and a step called end. An execution of the flow, which we call a run, starts at start. The run is successful if the final end step finishes successfully. What happens between start and end is up to you.\n",

    "- Notebooks are great when you want to tell a concise linear narrative as a single article. That’s why they are so great for teaching and learning. However, real-world applications tend to be non-linear, so it is better to structure the project as an explicit DAG which makes it more understandable for humans and more easily executable by computers.\n",
    "- A superpower of DAGs is that if you have parallel branches in your DAG, computer can execute them in parallel automatically, making your project finish much faster without you having to change much anything.\n",
    "- This means that you can e.g. train 200 models - one for each country of the world in parallel, even using multiple computers - which would be impossible to do in a notebook.\n",
